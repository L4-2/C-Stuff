# C-Stuff
Random C stuff I want to learn/test. I don't condone using any of this code for personal or commercial projects/implementation with the intent of production use. *You are free to use this for almost anything else. 

*Use within reason, obviously. I'm not responsible for any damages or disciplinary actions that result from using this code in your own application. Feel free to challenge yourself by using this code as a starting point.

Btw, I try to write this code all from scratch and not with AI. I realized I used AI a lot in the past and even now for languages I ~~hate~~ don't really want to learn (Python).
